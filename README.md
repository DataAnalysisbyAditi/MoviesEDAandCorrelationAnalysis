This project employs a fascinating movie dataset to generate insights and explore correlations between film earnings and various variables. Through this analysis, I advanced my Python skills by performing exploratory data analysis and creating interactive visualizations using Plotly to better understand the data.

Additionally, I conducted correlation analysis to identify which factors most significantly influence the gross earnings of movies.
